# PanzerPanic
Panzer Panic is a game where four players in two teams go head to head in tanks on a projected map from the top down perspective. The players control their tanks in two different methods, the gunner controls the turret with the joystick while the driver controls the movement of the tank and power-ups using a 360 controller. There are multiple maps to choose from.
